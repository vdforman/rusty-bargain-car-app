# rusty-bargain-car-app
This project's objective was to use machine learning to find the most accurate and time efficient model to use for an app that estimates a car's market value based off information about the car.

This project challenged me to not only consider an accurate model but also a model that won't take long to compute. That's very needed for an app; especially if people need it on the spot. For each trained model I used the class/library "time" to acquire the speed of each computation and included the results in my thought processes.
